Overview
---
This repository contains the source files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, I use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. The training, validation and testing is done using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to the virtual autonomous vehicle.

### Dependencies
This project requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit) which includes Anaconda and Tensorflow.

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources can be found in this github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py

The simulator can be downloaded from the classroom. However, this requires to be enrolled at the Udacity Self-Driving-Car course.
